# Iris-Flower-Classification
Machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into three species using sepal and petal measurements. Includes preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with a well-structured implementation

##1. Data Overview
The dataset was split into train (105 samples, 4 features) and test (45 samples, 4 features).

The dataset contains sepal and petal measurements for classification.

##2. Model Performance
Several models were evaluated:

Best model achieved 94.29% test accuracy.

Training accuracy varied from 73.33% to 100%, depending on the model.

Some models underperformed, with test accuracy as low as 30.48%.

##3. Key Observations
The testing accuracy of the Models includes the following:-
- Bernoulli NB : 30.48%
- Multinomial NB : 63.81%
- Decision Tree : 93.33%
- Random Forest : 93.33%
